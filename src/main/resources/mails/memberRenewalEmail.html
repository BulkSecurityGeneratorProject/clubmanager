    Good day {MEMBER_NAME}!
    <P/>
    <p>The Executive Board met to review the points for all Palmyra
        Racing Association members.  Based on a review of the records, your membership
        status for the 2017 season and beyond are as follows:</p>

    <p>2017 Status:       {STATUS}<br>
        2017 Dues:          {DUES}</p>

    <p>Should you find your status or dues listed to be in error,
        you have the right to appeal to the board to review your membership for the
        2017 season.   Contact any board member for further details on how to initiate
        this process.</p>

    <p>New for 2017, you can pay your dues online!  Please note
        that PayPal collects a 3% processing fee which will be added to your total at
        checkout.</p>
